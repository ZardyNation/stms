- Accent color: A deep black (#0A0A0A) for text, providing a stark contrast against the background and red elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short descriptions to add techy, scientific feel. Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body to maximize readability.
- Use simple, bold icons in red and black to represent each award category.
- Mobile-first, responsive layout that ensures readability and ease of use on all devices.
- Smooth scrolling effects and subtle hover animations on the nominees and 'Vote Now' button.
